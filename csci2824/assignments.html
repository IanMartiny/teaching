      <h2>Homework Exercises</h2>
      <p>
        There will be six homeworks during the semester that will
        count for 35% of your course grade.  Unless otherwise noted,
        you are free to discuss the problems and your general approach
        with other students in the class.  However, the answers you
        turn in must be your own original work, and you are bound by
        the Honor Code.  Please start early and attend your discussion
        section for important instructions and extra help.

      <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
      <p>
        There will be two-three projects during the semester that will
        count for 25% of your course grade.  Unless otherwise
        indicated, you can work with others.  You may consult
        general reference material, but you must submit your own program.
        The material you turn in must be entirely your own
        work, and you are bound by the Honor Code.  Please start early
        and attend your discussion for important instructions and
        extra help.

      <b>Lateness:</b> Assigned work is due at the dates and times listed
      above.  I strongly recommend that you get started early.  Late work will not
      be accepted, accept under unique and previously discussed circumstances.

      <p><b>Collaboration:</b> We are here to provide a nurturing
      environment for everyone enrolled in the course. However, acts
      of cheating and unacceptable collaboration will be reported to
      the Engineering or LS&amp;A Honor Councils, as
      appropriate. Cheating is when you copy, with or without
      modification, someone else&rsquo;s work that is not meant to be
      publicly accessible. Unacceptable collaboration is the knowing
      exposure of your own exam answers, project solutions, or
      homework solutions, or the use of someone else&rsquo;s answers or
      solutions.</p>
      <p>At the same time, we encourage students to help each other
      learn the course material. As in most courses, there is a
      boundary separating these two situations. You may give or
      receive help on any of the concepts covered in lecture. You are
      allowed to consult with other students about the
      conceptualization of a project, or the general approach for
      homework solutions. However, all written work, whether in scrap
      or final form, must be done by you.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions as to what constitutes unacceptable
      collaboration or exploitation of prior work, please talk to an
      instructor right away. You are expected to exercise reasonable
      precautions in protecting your own work.
